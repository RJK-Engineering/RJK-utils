Give us the news then, I'll give you this news: No matter the label you stick on it, Bernie is like a mainstream politician here in Europe, where we're ranked above the US in just about every welfare index you can think of. Healthcare, happiness, life expectancy, murders, I can go on for a while.. But a lot of Americans don't know that, they don't look outward, because if you believe your country is supreme, why would you?

Look at his actions for the past 40 years. He's an organizer, he recognizes he needs the people to get stuff done and is able to get a lot done for the people that way. And he's incredibly consistent, really the opposite of a fraud.

Marx is een reactie op het kapitalisme, Marx doet analyses, hij heeft niets te zeggen over hoe een land bestuurd moet worden, dat hebben de machthebbers helemaal zelf ingevuld. Als we het huidige systeem willen verbeteren zullen we het moeten bekritiseren, iets waar we in het westen erg goed in zijn, behalve als het om het systeem gaat dat ons leven bepaald, gek niet? Marx' werk is wat dat betreft, na al die tijd, nog steeds zeer relevant en wordt bestudeerd en geprezen over de gehele wereld.

​@chevious Mis "if we get organized" That's it, the people are there, the will is there, but for whatever reason they can't get organized, and that's exactly what Bernie says he's gonna do. Now that would be a change!

I've been following US politics for almost 10 years now, listening to the different sides, reading their comments almost every day. I see the developments, and it's absolutely not what you describe. I don't like getting into discussions because it often only polarizes more, but here's a question: We have the policies Bernie talks about here in my country, for example the "free" healthcare you talk about. Do you think it is actually free, as in that I don't have to pay anything ever? You're using an old, tiresome and misleading argument used by people who don't understand the systems at work, of which examples can be found in many countries around the world. So who's the "uninformed nitwit" here?

"... for its very survival requires it. Homosexual unions are by nature contradictory to this."
What a simple mind. Homosexuality probably has been vital in our evolution, the genes that result in homosexuality also result in all kinds of other beneficial traits. In fact there are arguments that the trait of homosexuality alone results in better survival of the species, contradictory as it sounds. If it was detrimental, we would've lost it a long time ago or it would never have existed.

If Bernie is elected, I will immediately quit my job.  Who will work with a socialist in the White House???
